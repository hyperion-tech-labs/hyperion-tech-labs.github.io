       <h4> The Problem</h4>
       <p> 
        New Reality, a B2B virtual reality (VR) company, was looking to design and build a new method for assessing an
individual's level of skill at a particular task in a VR environment. This would enable them to give faster feedback
and increase the effectiveness and speed of the learning process for any particular set of tasks one wishes to train
someone on. Such a system would be a new analytics engine that is able to form the foundation of assessing and
improving skills in the workplace. New Reality would use the solution to "digitize" current traditional training in the
market bringing a disruptive shift to this South African sector through effective analytics.

              <h4> The Solution</h4>
            <p>
             Hyperion Labs proposed a speed reading application that uses a <a href="https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/" style="color: #F56835;">perceptual expansion</a>
             method to train the user. The speed reading application was chosen as
            any test participant would not require prior training to obtain a control score. After a
            user undergoes the VR training procedure a second measurement is taken in order
            to determine the percentage improvement in the users reading speed. This method
            allows New Reality to quantitatively prove that a skill may be trained on a virtual
            reality platform.

            <br>
            
            The process of constructing an MVP is important as the data that is measured and
            analyzed must be piped to the correct databases and cloud compute platforms.
            Ensuring smooth flow of data is an essential foundation to building any data sets for
            machine learning applications. The diagram below outlines the Hyperion Labs
            solution.</p>

        New Reality uses the MVP application in order to gain further insights into the prospects of learning in fully immersive
        environments. Further iterations of the application is used as a demo for potential clients to experience
        the power of accelerated learning within virtual reality environments. The Hyperion Labs solution has paved the
       way for New Reality to build an entirely new revenue stream through a revolutionary product for the training and
        education sector.
       </p>
       

        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            On average, users of the speed reading app displayed a 200% increase in reading speed after a single round of
            training. This indicates that a skill can be taught and users quantitatively display an improvement in performing
            the task taught to them. Hyperion Labs proved that value can be added to a company’s strategy and technological
            capability through an innovation partnership.
